# Features
See [this listing](https://github.com/pedro-javierf/NTRGhidra/projects/1)

# Installation
If you just want to install the loader into a existing Ghidra installation:

1. Download the .zip from [releases](https://github.com/pedro-javierf/NTRGhidra/releases) OR build the project.
2. Put the .zip into the GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR/Extensions/Ghidra folder
3. In the initial window (not the Code Browser), open the File menu, and select Install Extensions. Click the small 'plus' icon in the top right of the window, and select the extension zip file downloaded. This should add an entry into the extensions list. Make sure it is checked and click OK.

# How to Build

NOTE: Current eclipse project extension debugging is not working after the update to Ghidra 9.2 with error: ```OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Archived non-system classes are disabled because the java.system.class.loader property is specified (value = "ghidra.GhidraClassLoader"). To use archived non-system classes, this property must not be set```. Builds are working but must be tested manually. If you have a solution for this or a way to rebuild the project you are more than welcome to create a pull request!

These are the basic steps to debug and build the loader. You must have a Ghidra installation.

1. Install Ghidra
2. Install the Eclipse IDE
3. In Eclipse, you need to install the Ghidra extension. Click Help > "Install New Software" (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31553376/eclipse-how-to-install-a-plugin-manually)
4. After the extension is installed, clone/download this repository, which contains an Eclipse project
5. Open the project with Eclipse (File > Open Projects from File System)
6. Export a build of the project in Eclipse select "File > Export", and then choose "Ghidra > Ghidra Module Extension". You can then use a local Gradle installation or an online build system.
